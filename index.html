      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>First of all, let me introduce myself, I am Pooja Rani and recently I have been working in I.G. girl’s college Kaithal as a lecturer (mathematics). I have attended my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Math from Kurukshetra University.</p>
      <p> Academics are my highest priority, but I maintain a well-balanced lifestyle by pursuing the pleasures in life: spending time with friends and family, working hard at my job and gaining a dependable income, and exercising by Yoga session thrice a week. I have lived a very unique and special life, learning a vast number of lessons along the way. In my life, I have traveled to different states, exposing myself to new cultures, and have adapted in a way that was accepted by those cultures.
      </p>
      <p> In terms of social work, I joined two NGOs, s first was Dr. Ambedkar Education Society Kaithal, and the second was Shanti Mandal Morcha who works for providing education to the homeless children in my hometown. Also, I donated blood twice in my life.

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>I'd like to Learn more about:</p>
      <ul class="skills">
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Offline websites</li>
      </ul>
      <p> At present, I am doing Data Analytics Diploma from Douglas College. After completion of the course, I will start my career as Data Analyst. My country is a very fast-growing country and there are ample amount of opportunities for data analysts in the years to come. I would have a complete understanding of the life cycle of a data science project. I would understand and appreciate the beauty of visualization to get the hidden patterns in the data. </p>
      <p>In Five years down the line I will probably be leading a small team (depending on organization hierarchy), teaching them a few things, and learning from them a lot more while solving more complex and domain particular problems. I would be an expert in a few areas of the field and a novice in a few! My interest to learn would still not be quenched and I would start to explore more on developing more niche techniques such as NLP.
      </p>
      <p>After completion of my study and getting the desired job my priorities/goals would be my family.</p>
